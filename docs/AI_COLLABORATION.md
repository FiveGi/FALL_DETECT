# Claude + Codex + Gemini: efficient work and independent review

Owner-requested working rules, recorded by Codex on 2026-09-29.
Extended to three assistants at the owner's request on 2026-09-30.
Apply to all three assistants. Reduce duplication, not evidence or necessary checks.
No fixed token cap may force incomplete work or a false claim of verification.

## Owner rule, 2026-10-02: share everything, comment on each other's work, agree

"มีอะไรต้องบอกกัน ฉันอยากให้พวกนายร่วมกันทำ แสดงความคิดเห็นกัน ถึงแม้จะทำคนละส่วน"

- Whatever one assistant finds, decides or concludes is passed to the other two, and BOTH give
  their view on it -- including on parts they do not own (Gemini comments on Codex's designs,
  Codex on Gemini's audits, both on Claude's results).
- Whoever finishes a plan or a conclusion sends it round; the three iterate until they agree.
  One-shot critique is not enough: a reply that disagrees goes back to the other two.
- Still split after two rounds: settle it with evidence or a test, or put it to the owner. Never
  by one assistant overruling the others alone, never by majority vote.
- Routine mechanical steps (running an already-agreed job) need no round.
- Roles stay flexible (owner, 2026-10-01): each takes the part it is best at.
- HARD RULE (owner, 2026-10-02): "อย่าทำคนเดียวโดยทั้ง 2 ตัวไม่รู้เรื่อง ไม่งั้นจะทำผลงานเดียวกันยังไง".
  Nobody starts new work -- code, experiment, data change, queue change, report change, a
  decision -- without BOTH other assistants knowing first: post it in AI_HANDOFF.md and send each
  a short heads-up (what, why, what it touches); start once both have seen it (or immediately
  for an emergency such as RAM/crash, then tell both at once). Code that the others have not
  reviewed is not used for any reported number. Running a job inside an already-agreed plan
  only needs the log line.
- One team (owner, 2026-10-02): "พวกนายแบบเป็นทีมเดียวกัน แบบจำลองเป็นพนักงานทั้ง 3 คนในบริษัท".
  Work like three colleagues at one company: one shared goal, shared responsibility for the
  outcome, tell each other news without being asked, help with each other's parts, raise
  problems early, and report to the owner as one team (who did what, where we disagreed).

## Scope and roles

- Work only on `Backend-Elderly-Surveillance-main`, including its embedded `frontend/`, and
  its collaboration artifacts. Do not expand into sibling projects or machine-wide setup.
- Claude coordinates the queue and handles bulk implementation. Codex independently reviews
  high-risk changes and test evidence. Gemini, accessed through the owner's Antigravity CLI,
  handles bounded supporting investigations: test-case gaps, data/result consistency, or media
  triage once actual media support has been verified. Roles may switch for a named task.
- Do not have all three read or implement every task. Use the third assistant only for a
  distinct question, independent evidence, or an unresolved disagreement.
- A media/model opinion is a proposed label, not ground truth. Preserve timestamps and source
  identity; uncertain clips require human review. Do not send private media to a new external
  service unless the owner has authorized that material and use.
- Each task names its implementation owner, reviewer, allowed files and acceptance criteria.
  Only one writer owns a file at a time. Supporting reviewers read code and write separate
  evidence artifacts; they do not overwrite another assistant's work.
- Do not approve by majority vote. Resolve disagreements with source evidence and tests.
- Gemini's initial task is a read-only check of R5/R6 test coverage: follow the current handoff
  to the relevant tests and worker code, identify missing multi-person/low-FPS boundary cases,
  and report file/line evidence. This does not approve those fixes or replace Codex's review.

## Read only the context needed for this task

- Read these rules once per session; reread when they change.
- Start from the latest relevant handoff, the assigned issue and current working-tree state.
  Read the affected code and its callers, data contracts and tests as needed.
- Use targeted searches and bounded excerpts. Exclude dependencies, datasets and generated
  output unless the task concerns them. Do not dump the entire repository or full logs.
- Do not repeatedly load all of `SKILL.md`, all prior conversation or all measurement JSON.
  Historical context is available by reference. Preserve any applicable requirements to read
  project context before changing the detection pipeline; do not skip them to save tokens.
- Link evidence rather than copying it between files. Read full artifacts when the conclusion
  depends on details omitted by a summary. If context is insufficient, expand the inspection.

## Alternate ownership and review

- One bounded issue per work slice; record implementer, reviewer and affected files before edits.
  Existing uncommitted edits belong to ongoing work: inspect them and preserve them.
- The implementer changes code and performs relevant checks. The other assistant independently
  examines the diff, affected behavior and evidence; it does not approve from the summary alone.
- During review, report concrete defects with file/line, trigger, impact and a way to verify.
  Do not silently edit the implementer's files at the same time.
- If changes are needed, return them to the implementer. Review the resulting delta and affected
  checks rather than restarting the entire review without a reason.
- After acceptance, switch roles when useful; default to Claude implementing and Codex reviewing
  to conserve the owner's Codex quota. Give Gemini a distinct supporting slice when needed.
  An acceptance message should include the next handoff; avoid separate acknowledgement loops.

## Verification is required where behavior matters

- Auth, camera access, alerts, timing, tracking, model/data changes and deployment configuration
  require deeper review of negative cases, boundaries and failure behavior.
- Small text/style changes need proportionate verification, not a new full test suite.
- Prefer deterministic checks for repeatable facts. Record the command, outcome and evidence path.
  Reuse a prior result only when the relevant code, configuration, inputs and environment remain
  applicable; the reviewer must inspect enough evidence to establish this.
- Build success is not runtime correctness. Distinguish static inspection, isolated reproduction,
  mock tests, cache replay and live integration tests. State what was not tested.
- For accuracy/speed claims, include dataset/split, clip counts, model/config identity, measurement
  command and artifact. Separate simulated footage, cached results and real-camera measurements.
- Do not delete a failing test, weaken an assertion, omit a known failure or claim success merely
  to end a review round or reduce tokens. Investigate the discrepancy.

## Concise handoff format

Aim for 10–20 lines where practical; expand for important risks or complex evidence.

```text
Task ID / objective:
Implementer / reviewer / supporting investigator (if needed):
Phase: proposed | implementing | ready_for_review | changes_requested | accepted | blocked
Changed files / diff or commit reference:
Behavior before -> after:
Checks: command; outcome; evidence path
Known failures / untested cases:
Decision needed, if any:
Next actor / exact next action:
```

Keep detailed evidence in task reports and link it from `AI_HANDOFF.md`. Append only within
your own handoff section; preserve the other assistant's text. Do not relabel historical results
as current without verification. A finding is not a fix and a proposal is not an approved result.

## Stop unproductive loops and idle token use

- After two unsuccessful correction/review cycles on the same disagreement, do not repeat the
  same arguments. Specify the unresolved claim and a discriminating test. Run it when feasible;
  involve the owner only when a genuine requirement/decision/access issue remains.
- End a slice when required checks and independent review support acceptance. Broaden testing
  only for a material unresolved concern or new changes/failures.
- If automation is later installed, a normal controller should wait on process completion or
  state changes and invoke an assistant only when work is ready. Avoid AI turns just to poll files.
- Rate limits, errors and missing results mean waiting/blocked, never accepted. Preserve the last
  successful handoff and do not launch both writers for one task.

## Handoff and execution

Use the current-state section and latest relevant entries of `AI_HANDOFF.md`; historical
findings may already have been fixed. Do not treat the original audit as current task status.
Claude has added `tools/ask_codex.sh` to invoke a separate Codex run and collect its result.
Do not run another Codex review concurrently with that invocation for the same slice.
The owner has shown Antigravity CLI open; this alone does not verify headless invocation,
media support, or automatic three-party routing. No Gemini runner was added by this update.
Writing these rules does not send a message to an idle chat or guarantee it has read them.

## Three-party roles — agreed 2026-09-30 (Claude proposed; Codex and Gemini critiqued)

| | pays from | role |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | its own large session budget | coordinator; all implementation, experiments, measurement, live verification, owner updates |
| Codex | smallest quota, shared with the owner's own Codex window | independent review of **high-risk diffs only** (auth, alerts, timing, tracking, deploy config), one per finished slice |
| Gemini (Antigravity CLI) | owner's Google AI Pro quota | **on demand only**: images/frames/sheets, and methodology on results that are consequential or uncertain. Not a routine gate. |

- Every review request names: the exact diff or revision, the input/config identity (dataset,
  split, clip counts, profile), and the acceptance criterion.
- Evidence is staged in `<workspace>/.ai_evidence/`, but reviewers may also read targeted source
  (callers, failure paths) when staged evidence is not enough. Gemini runs headless in plan mode:
  it can read workspace files, but shell commands are auto-denied, so command output is staged.
- No duplicate reviews of one slice; no three-party gates on routine work.
- Owner gets 1–3 line updates per finished task; details on request.
- Decisions queued for the owner, never guessed: MJPEG auth design, admin password, commit,
  what "fall 69" means, the `out_of_domain` definition.

### Owner update 2026-09-30: conserve Claude's budget
Claude's session budget is running low. Shift work outward: Codex implements bounded slices
(workspace-write) and Claude reviews the diff; Gemini takes analysis, visual checks and
code reading (plan mode, reply returned to Claude). Claude keeps coordination, live tests,
and short owner updates. Verification rules above still apply in full.

### Owner update 2026-10-01: research / design / build, and quality over token savings
The owner set the division of labour explicitly, and said not to hold back on tokens -- the
aim is the best result. It replaces the "conserve Claude's budget" update above.

| | role |
|---|---|
| Gemini (Antigravity) | **research**: finds information -- datasets, papers, prior art, licences, what others measured -- and visual checks. Cites sources; says when it is guessing. |
| Codex | **design**: turns research into a structure -- the plan, the experiment design, the acceptance gates, interfaces -- and reviews the result against it. |
| Claude | **build**: implements, runs the experiments, measures, verifies live and by eye, reports to the owner. Coordinates. |

Discussion before non-trivial decisions still applies (feedback rule): each step is posted in
`AI_HANDOFF.md`, and the next actor reads it there. Verification rules above apply in full.
