"""Short-lived, camera-scoped credentials for the live MJPEG view.

A browser loads the live view as `<img src=...>`, which cannot send an Authorization header, so
until now `GET /api/stream/camera/<id>` served any camera's video to anyone who could reach the
API. The frontend's workaround made it worse: it appended the user's full JWT access token to
the image URL as `?token=`, so a credential valid for every API ended up in access logs,
browser history and anything that records URLs -- and the backend never even read it.

Design, agreed after Codex's and Gemini's critiques (AI_HANDOFF.md, 2026-09-30):

- The token is NOT a JWT. It is signed with itsdangerous under its own salt, so a leaked media
  token cannot be replayed as a bearer token against any other endpoint, and an access token
  cannot be passed off as a media token.
- It binds the user id, the camera id and the issuing session's JWT `jti`. At connect time the
  server re-checks everything rather than trusting the token: signature, age, that the user
  still exists and still owns the camera (or is an admin), that the camera exists, and that the
  session has not been logged out (`token_blocklist`). Logging out therefore revokes it.
- It can only START a view for START_SECONDS. A view then lasts at most STREAM_MAX_SECONDS and
  is closed by the server; the client reconnects with a fresh token. So a leaked URL is worth at
  most one START_SECONDS window plus one STREAM_MAX_SECONDS view -- the owner-level numbers
  stated in the handoff for confirmation.
- The query token is redacted from the request log.

Deployment requirements this code cannot enforce and does not pretend to: HTTPS, and a strong,
non-default SECRET_KEY (a warning is printed when the default is in use).
